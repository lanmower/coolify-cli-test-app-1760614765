# Coolify CLI - Current Status

## ✅ What's Working

1. **Authentication** - Successfully logs in and maintains session
2. **CSRF Management** - Properly refreshes tokens for each request
3. **Project Navigation** - Finds projects and environments
4. **Livewire Protocol** - Uses correct `/livewire/update` endpoint
5. **Form Detection** - Finds and extracts Livewire components from pages
6. **HTTP Requests** - All returning 200 OK with proper structure

## ⚠️ Current Issue

**Applications are not being created despite successful form submission (200 response).**

The Livewire payload structure is likely incomplete or incorrect. Need to:

1. Manually fill the form in browser
2. Capture the EXACT Livewire POST request 
3. Compare with CLI's current payload
4. Update CLI to match exact structure

## 📊 Test Evidence

```bash
$ node coolify-deploy.cjs

✅ Logged in successfully
✅ Using project: mcssok0k4s00kc0sg4g4ow0o
✅ Environment: i0kog8s80kw04gwo4gsskk08
✅ Found form component: vLB0AnKBXE4vsrYM0ZLo
🚀 Submitting application creation form...
📊 Response status: 200  ← SUCCESS RESPONSE
📄 Response: {"components":[],"assets":[]}  ← Empty but valid
```

But checking environment shows 0 applications created.

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Browser open at: https://coolify.acc.l-inc.co.za/project/mcssok0k4s00kc0sg4g4ow0o/environment/i0kog8s80kw04gwo4gsskk08/new?type=public&destination=mks0ss0wkgko0c8cocogssoc&server_id=0

2. Manually fill form:
   - Repository: https://github.com/lanmower/coolify-cli-test-app-1760614765
   - Branch: master
   - Port: 3000
   - Domain: coolify-cli-test-app.acc.l-inc.co.za

3. Submit and capture the Livewire POST with browser DevTools

4. Compare captured payload with CLI's current payload structure
