## 📋 Current Status

The Coolify instance is **functionally accessible** with proper authentication and page loading. However, it appears to be in an **unconfigured state** requiring initial server/destination setup before deployments can be created.

The "+ Add" button is present in the projects section, but the full deployment workflow needs the underlying infrastructure configured first.

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Configure Server/Destination**: Set up at least one deployment target
2. **Test Repository Deployment**: Try deploying the test repository `AnEntrypoint/nixpacks-test-app`
3. **Network Analysis**: Capture Livewire communications during deployment
4. **Log Monitoring**: Verify deployment logs and status tracking
5. **Final Verification**: Confirm the deployed application is accessible
